## Current Improvements

### New
- JSON schema validation for chromosome structure
- Schema enforcement for required genes array
- Added validation error logging
- Refactored complex method into focused helper functions
- Added proper error propagation for monitoring
- Fixed test consistency issues

### Remaining
- Schema parameters need real-world tuning
- Metrics for validation failures
- Schema versioning not implemented
- Centralized logging pending

### Next Steps
1. Collect sample chromosomes for schema refinement
2. Add schema version to metadata
3. Implement validation metrics endpoint
4. Load test with realistic DNA samples

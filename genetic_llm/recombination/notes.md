## Updated Considerations

New Implementations:
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Replaced print statements with structured logging
- Added detailed error context for failed recombinations

Remaining Issues:
- Still need JSON validation for chromosome structure
- No performance metrics for retry effectiveness
- Logging configuration not centralized

Next Steps:
1. Implement JSON schema validation for chromosome structure
2. Add metrics tracking for success/failure rates
3. Create shared logging configuration
4. Test with real-world chromosome structures

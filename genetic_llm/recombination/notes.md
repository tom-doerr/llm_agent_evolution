# Current Considerations

## Implementation Notes
- External LM API dependency introduces potential flakiness
- Silent error swallowing makes debugging production issues harder
- String type enforcement prevents complex chromosome structures

## Test Coverage Gaps
- Real-world LM output validation
- Performance under load/stress
- Cross-language compatibility

## Next Steps
1. Add integration tests with mocked LM responses
2. Consider JSON validation for chromosome structure
3. Implement retry logic for LM calls
4. Add logging configuration for error tracking
5. Benchmark different LM providers for recombination quality

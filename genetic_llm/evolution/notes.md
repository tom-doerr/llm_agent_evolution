## Current Implementation Notes

- Parent selection now handles single-parent edge cases
- Chromosome type preservation verified through enhanced testing
- Elite preservation logic working as intended

## Known Issues

- No mutation mechanism implemented yet
- Mate selection could benefit from fitness-aware pairing
- Small population edge cases need more test coverage

## Next Steps

1. Implement mutation operator
2. Add fitness-proportionate mate selection
3. Create integration test with DSPy components
4. Add validation for chromosome structure during recombination

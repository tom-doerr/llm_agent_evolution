## Current Implementation Notes

- Parent selection now handles single-parent edge cases
- Chromosome type preservation verified through enhanced testing
- Elite preservation logic working as intended

## Known Issues

- No mutation mechanism implemented yet
- Mate selection could benefit from fitness-aware pairing
- Small population edge cases need more test coverage
- Chromosome validation needed before recombination
- No timeout handling for LLM API calls

## Next Steps

1. Implement mutation operator ‚Üê HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. Add JSON schema validation for chromosomes
3. Create integration test with DSPy components
4. Add timeout handling for model requests
5. Centralize logging configuration

# Evolution Module Notes

## Current Implementation Notes

- JSON schema validation implemented for chromosomes
- Validation occurs before evolution and after recombination/mutation
- Basic schema testing coverage added
- Basic mutation operator implemented with configurable rate  
- Mutation applied post-recombination to all chromosomes
- Elite preservation logic working as intended
- Default schemas implemented for core chromosome types:
  - DNA: Requires valid nucleotide sequence
  - PROMPT: Minimum 10-character text with optional variables
  - MODEL_CONFIG: Supported model types with valid parameters

## Known Issues

- Validation could impact performance with large populations
- Error handling needs more granularity (warnings vs errors)
- Mutation operator needs more sophisticated implementations
- No crossover/mutation balance tuning
- Mutation rate not validated in config
- No timeout handling for LLM API calls
- Response format schema not yet implemented
- Model parameter ranges may need adjustment
- No schema versioning system

## Next Steps

1. Implement validation caching for performance
2. Add schema version compatibility checks
3. Create schema migration system for evolving formats
4. Develop GUI schema editor for non-technical users
5. Create DSPy integration tests
6. Develop more complex mutation strategies
7. Add timeout handling for model requests

## Current Implementation Notes

- Basic mutation operator implemented with configurable rate
- Mutation applied post-recombination to all chromosomes
- Mutation tests verify application and rate compliance
- Elite preservation logic working as intended

## Known Issues

- Mutation operator needs more sophisticated implementations
- No crossover/mutation balance tuning
- Mutation rate not validated in config
- Chromosome validation needed before recombination
- No timeout handling for LLM API calls

## Next Steps

1. Implement adaptive mutation rates
2. Add JSON schema validation for chromosomes
3. Create DSPy integration tests
4. Develop more complex mutation strategies
5. Add timeout handling for model requests

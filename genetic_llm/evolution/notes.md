# Evolution Module Notes

## Current Implementation Notes

- JSON schema validation implemented for chromosomes
- Validation occurs before evolution and after recombination/mutation
- Basic schema testing coverage added
- Basic mutation operator implemented with configurable rate  
- Mutation applied post-recombination to all chromosomes
- Elite preservation logic working as intended

## Known Issues

- No default schemas provided for common chromosome types
- Validation could impact performance with large populations
- Error handling needs more granularity (warnings vs errors)
- Mutation operator needs more sophisticated implementations
- No crossover/mutation balance tuning
- Mutation rate not validated in config
- No timeout handling for LLM API calls

## Next Steps

1. Create default schemas for common chromosome types
2. Implement validation caching for performance
3. Add config option to disable validation
4. Develop repair mechanisms for invalid chromosomes
5. Create DSPy integration tests
6. Develop more complex mutation strategies
7. Add timeout handling for model requests

## Current Issues

- Fitness normalization needs more sophisticated scaling  
- Limited mutation implementation  
- Selection pressure not configurable  

## Next Steps
1. Add mutation operators
2. Implement different selection strategies
3. Add elitism mechanism
4. Create CLI runner for experiments

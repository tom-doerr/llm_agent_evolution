## Current Issues

- Model could return float values that truncate to valid indices
- No validation that fitness values are set before selection
- Model instructions could be more precise about integer requirement

## Next Steps

1. Add input validation for agent fitness values
2. Enhance model instructions to emphasize integer indices
3. Consider adding integration tests with real model
4. Implement logging for model responses

# Project Notes

## Current Issues

- Thread-based timeout may have subtle threading issues
- Need to test timeout implementation across platforms
- Retry delay uses simple backoff but could be configurable

## Next Steps

1. Add configuration documentation
2. Implement thread safety analysis
3. Create Windows/MacOS CI testing
4. Add configuration examples
